[Extended Matrix 3D tools](http://extendedmatrix.org) - shortly EMBT, is an addon for Blender 3.x designed and developed by E. Demetrescu (CNR ISPC, ex ITABC) - EM 3D tools offers:

* Integration of Extended Matrix language with Blender
* Full support to create and visualize reconstruction hypotheses (EM reconstructive workflow)
* Full support to annotate archaeological stratigraphy in 3D (EM archaeological workflow)
* Full support to annotate masonry stratigraphy (EM architectonical survey workflow) 
* Export full dataset to ATON 3 (EMviq app)

## Getting started (quick)
1) Preferably install the addon using the last stable version from the [EM site](https://www.extendedmatrix.org/download). Please use directly the github version here only if you know how to handle it (more for developers..).

2) Quickstart (to come..) 

# Citation
You can cite Extended Matrix using with the following BibTeX entry:

# Contribute
You are more than welcome to contribute to the project by spotting bugs/issues and providing code or solutions through pull requests to fix or improve EM functionalities (see TODO list below). Get in touch here on github, through the [telegram open-group](https://t.me/UserGroupEM) or through the other channels.

# TODO list

## EM
- [ ] Alternative hypothesis formalization
- [ ] New metaphors of visualization for anastylosis and virtual restoration
- [ ] Formalization of color maps to visualize statistical data about the reconstruction (volumes, typo of sources, property density)

## EMF

- [ ] Statistical tools for the reconstrucion (volumes, typo of sources, property density)
- [ ] New label system
- [ ] Simplified proxy generation
